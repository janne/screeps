# Janne's Screens Script in Typescript

This is my attempt at building something for [Screeps](https://screeps.com/), the MMO sandbox for programmers.

## Setup

- Install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (10.x)
- Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/getting-started)
- Copy `screeps.sample.json` to `screeps.json` and update the credentials
- Push the code
  - `yarn push-main` or `yarn push-sim`
- Or push and watch local changes
  - `yarn watch-main` or `yarn watch-sim`

There are also `pserver` variants of above. To upload code to a private server, you must have [screepsmod-auth](https://github.com/ScreepsMods/screepsmod-auth) installed and configured.
